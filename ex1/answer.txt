a kernel module is much a part of the kernel as any normal kernel code when it's loaded and it has access to the services of the already loaded modules.

There is two ways to load a kernel module :
-The first way is to use the insmod command to manually insert the it into the kernel
-The second is to load the module as it is needed throught kerneld which scheduling the work

To allocate new module ismod asks the kernel for enough space to hold the new kernel using a privileged system call. The kernel allocates a new module data structure and enough kernel memory to hold the new module and puts it at the end of the kernel modules list.
